# Transparent Armor

This Fabric mod adds invisible armor for use with the [cosmetic armor](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cosmetic-armor-fabric) mod.

This armor has little durability, no protection and no enchantability, but it is completely invisible and it can be equipped in cosmetic/vanity slots to hide your regular armor and show your skin.

To craft it, simply use glass blocks in the shape of a helmet, chestplate, leggings and boots in the crafting table.
